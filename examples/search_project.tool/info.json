  "description": "Search project files by content pattern (grep-style regex), file name pattern (glob), modification date, or file size. Important glob pattern notes:\n\n1. Directory Traversal:\n   * `**` matches zero or more directory levels\n   * ONLY use `**` between directory separators\n   * Cannot use `**` within a filename\n\n2. File Matching:\n   * `*` matches any characters within a filename or directory name\n   * Use `*` for matching parts of filenames\n\n3. Common Patterns:\n   * `docs/*` - files IN docs directory only\n   * `docs/**/*` - files in docs SUBDIRECTORIES only\n   * `docs/*|docs/**/*` - files in docs AND its subdirectories\n   * `src/*.ts|src/**/*.ts` - TypeScript files in src and subdirectories\n   * `**/*.test.ts` - test files at any depth\n\n4. Pattern Components:\n   * `**/dir/*` - files in any 'dir' directory\n   * `path/to/**/file.ts` - specific file at any depth\n   * `**/*util*.ts` - files containing 'util' at any depth\n\nUse search_project when you don't know exact file paths. For known paths, use request_files instead.",
